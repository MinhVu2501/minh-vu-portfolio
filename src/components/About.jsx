        <h3>Minh Vu — Full-Stack Web Developer</h3>
        <p>
          I’m a dedicated Full-Stack Web Developer with hands-on experience building modern, responsive websites
          using React, Node.js, Express, and Tailwind CSS. I focus on clean design, smooth user experience, and
          reliable functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          I help small businesses, creators, and entrepreneurs turn ideas into fast, professional websites — from
          landing pages to full web applications. I currently work evenings in manufacturing and dedicate mornings
          and weekends to freelance web development.
